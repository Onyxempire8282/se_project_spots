# Project 3

This is my project called Spots.

### Overview

Spots is a small webpage I built that uses:

HTML — for the structure of the page.

CSS — for styling things like the layout, fonts, and colors.

Responsive Design — so it looks good on phones, tablets, and computers. (I used media queries for this.)

**Intro**

It's a simple project but it helped me understand how to build a basic responsive website.
